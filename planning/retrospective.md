# Retrospective

## Stop Doing

- Too many changes/files on a single pr
- Muck up the code with irrelevant/obsolete comments

## Continue Doing

- Ask for help from coaches and fellow students when things are unclear
- Study groups, even on individual projects. It helps a lot
- Plan ahead, set schedule and realistic daily/weekly goals
- Take advantage of external resources

## Start Doing

- Relearn js methods, css and figma
- Read more on the computer side of code
- Go through more of the suggested material

## Lessons Learned

- Refactoring functions
- Creating/documenting/manipulating DOM elements
- Using listeners, handlers logic/utils and procedure functions
- svg dependency graphs

## Strategy vs. Board

- Following the strategy was challenging on this project. Code was basically a puzzle needed to be put together and in order to work on one issue many other issues were involved. In hindsight i know i could have done a better job breaking down my pr into smaller chunks but as far as the js component of the assignment was concerned i am not sure how i could have done so

### What parts of your plan went as expected?

- Scheduling and being able to follow study/practice plan

### What parts of your plan did not work out?

- I had ambitions to add a few 'could haves' (export option, spellcheck) that didn't pan through. also figma and css took way longer than anticipated do to being out of practice

### Did you need to add things that weren't in your strategy?

- i should have considered more not just what needed to be done but the order of operations. a lot of time was wasted skipping back and forth between tasks that could have been solved better one at a time
